            <h1>What can you say about us?</h1>
            <p> We are simple young people from a simple city, who just caught fire with the idea of self-improvement. We decided to start changing our lives in the direction of programming.</p>
            <p>Many may think that it is easy, but believe me, it is not so:) for a short time, while we are engaged in the creation of sites, we have learned one very important lesson - never give up. And now without jokes, this seriously it is important. You can say: "It's just a hobby","It's not serious, you shouldn't do it" - never listen. For the most part, this is said by people who have not achieved anything worthwhile in their lives and are just trying to drag you along into this "swamp".</p>
            <p>This is our first more or less normal site that just warms the soul at every opening. It contains almost all the information about us, about our lives and our closest friends. =all good and positive=</p>
